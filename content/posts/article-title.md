“You better not screw it up, my dear.” The maiden caressed her lioness pet while watching a deer from afar. It was a clear day on the plains of Yagacan, at a time when there was nothing to do but hunt.

Her furry companion snorted in disbelief and growled as if sighing. The last time the duo hunted, Lilac had cried because she pitied their prey. How could she not? The discord of the target felt so vivid to her that it was as if she were the one being hunted herself.
Yet it will be different this time, She will give her pray freedom to run instead of.
