If a lab speaks in silence, only then a sound can be heard. White walls stained by red, clear under the incandescent bright. Cut here and there—my mad exploration against the captive specimen.

If duty calls, then I could engage in horror. I’ve done this. It was a great pursuit of biology, well, it was before it striked.

Have nothing now. Have nothing to pride. I’ll pluck one finger and another. One organ and another, and there are far more worse.

I’ve done this. If war persisted, duty calls.

### Authors Note

I got writer's block while writing Calamity Seal, so I wrote a grimdark flash fiction instead.
