Lab speaks in silence, after that, noises can be heard. White walls are stained by dried red under the lined lights. Cut here and there, it is just another day against the captive specimen.

If duty calls, then I could engage in horror. I’ve done this. It was a great pursuit in biology. Well, It once was, before the day it striked.

Have nothing now but disgraced perhaps. Still, I’ll pluck one finger and another. One organ and another, and there will be far more worse.

I’ve done this. If war prolonged, duty calls.

### Authors Note

I got writer's block while writing Calamity Seal, so I wrote a grimdark flash fiction instead.
