A relic that can imbue life to the colorless fabric of reality remains in a state of stasis. It has been years since it was. Unchanged. No cold and no warmth either.

Seasons crossed the scarlet barren land of no progress. Many had assumed themselves as catalysts and only met their doom. Yet one unremarkable soul had braved.

The great mage—renowned with years of deep understanding—who concealed the relic in perpetual stagnation laments that someone had barged in and put an end to the stasis.

He was furious and confused; he too had braved his longing.

### Authors Note

To my friend who is currently in the agony of heartbreak.
