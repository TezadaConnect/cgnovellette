To the person I adore,
Who owns a vast ocean in her eyes.
Serene under a cloudless sky,
How I wished I had found it sooner.

I knew never was the ocean calm,
Nor does it reflect me in its raging waves.
I once traversed such turbulent waters,
Goodness! How frightening it was.

However, in stormy solitary night even,
I am set for a perpetual sail.
For unlike those days of turmoil,
For you, I vow to be brave.
