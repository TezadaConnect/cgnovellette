Hi! I’ve decided to take on the 2024 NaNoWriMo challenge this November, and I'll be sharing my progress here.

**Project Title:** [Calamity Seal](https://www.novlr.org/share/6729a9180eb2890021c2c039/6715f5ddfeec660022fb1223/671f64a2f1233d849b526513)

**Note:** This is unedited, quick-draft writing using simple vocabulary to keep up with the pace—I'm aiming for about 100–250 words every 10 minutes with a minimum of 1100 words per day.

I'll be updating soon, so stay tuned! I’m also considering whether I’d like to self-publish or seek a publisher to support the book once it’s complete.
