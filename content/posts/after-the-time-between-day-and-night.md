The road was inevitable as a bachelorette walked toward the building. Inside, a man in a dark suit waited for her, watching her through the glass walls. She passed through and greeted him with a smile honed by years of practice.

"Good day, sir. May I ask how I can help you?" she said, her voice hints at worry.

The man sighed, his eyes stared at her unwavering. He replied, ”You've had a golden journey, but remember...” He paused, the words heavy, “All roads lead to me.”

She closed her eyes, trying to make sense of his words. When she opened them again, the scene dissolved. Harsh light flooded her vision. It was from her computer glowing in the dark, cold office room. Her work was done, but the emptiness lingered.

She lit the lamp and glanced out the window in front of her. Behind it was a city full of lights, yet what she saw was a reflection staring at her --- tired, worn, and unfamiliar. It was after the time between day and night that she truly saw herself.

### Authors Note

I always push myself hard, regardless of the consequences, until I was hospitalized. It was then that my immune system weakened, and I was diagnosed with chronic kidney disease. My perspective shifted to something else, something better, as if I no longer knew myself.
