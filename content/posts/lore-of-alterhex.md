In the primordial abyss of utter darkness, where only the vast realms of time and space existed, six divine dragons emerged—beings of unimaginable power and elemental influence. Among them were the Wind and Water Dragons, who, in their cosmic wanderings, discovered a massive boulder drifting alone in the void. The Water Dragon claimed the boulder, enveloping it entirely in a great ocean. This act ignited the fury of the Wind Dragon, who retaliated by gathering cosmic rocks from the void and hurling them into the ocean, causing waves and upheavals that shaped the land in a fierce display of power.

Their clash soon attracted the attention of the Light Dragon, the eldest and most potent of the Divines. With a burst of holy radiance, the Light Dragon blinded both adversaries, abruptly ending their battle.

In the aftermath, the Earth Dragon took the scattered remnants of dirt and crafted them into vibrant landscapes of green, with lush forests and sprawling meadows. The once barren boulder, now transformed into a fertile world, became a cradle of life.

Enthralled by the Earth Dragon’s creation, the Fire Dragon sought to leave its mark by creating a volcano. Its eruption, though spectacular, marred part of the Earth Dragon’s work. Despite the damage, the Earth Dragon, with her boundless compassion, forgave her fiery sibling.

The Light Dragon, ever proud, mocked the Fire Dragon’s efforts and demonstrated true creation by crafting the sun, bathing the new world in light and warmth. The Dark Dragon, however, remained aloof, hiding in the shadows of the now-transformed boulder.

Desiring living beings to cherish her creation, the Earth Dragon brought forth the elves from bamboo sprouts. These beings, endowed with a profound connection to the earth, flourished under the Earth Dragon’s favor.

Inspired and humbled by the Earth Dragon's success, the Fire Dragon sought guidance to create life of her own. Over millennia, she shaped the most intricate and perfect beings—humans. Though initially powerless, they thrived under the Fire Dragon’s nurturing love.

The Light Dragon, intrigued by this new creation, celebrated it with great enthusiasm, while the Earth Dragon took pride in the Fire Dragon’s work. The Dark Dragon remained indifferent. Meanwhile, the Light Dragon, inspired by these developments, forged an army of divine beings known as Angels, who possessed immense knowledge and power.

The remaining dragons, witnessing the rise of these celestial armies, each crafted their own legions—beasts of varying forms and powers, capable of great destruction.

In the midst of this divine drama, the World Weaver visited the Dark Dragon. The Dark Dragon, indifferent at first, soon felt the weight of fate beginning to envelop him. Despite his efforts to resist, corruption spread through him, leading him to sever his own form into four parts: head, tail, left wing, and right wing. From this schism, the Demons were born.

The tainted Angels, now corrupted, spread their malign influence, leading to their expulsion from Paradise by the Light Dragon. Their fall to the land created a massive crater, further destabilizing the world.

In the ensuing chaos, the Fire Dragon, determined to protect her creations, was drawn into a rift of profound darkness. The Wind Tribe beasts waged war against the Water Tribe beasts, leading to widespread devastation.

The Earth Dragon rallied guardians to protect her realm and the remaining creations of the Fire Dragon. The Light Dragon vanished, leaving a void of uncertainty.

Thus, under the shadow of Divine Fate—the World Weaver—each divine dragon and their creations were afflicted with a profound curse, sealing their fates in a cycle of torment and struggle. The once-promising realms were marred by relentless discord and suffering. From this cosmic tragedy, Alterhex was born—a land forever scarred by divine conflict, where hope flickers amidst the relentless shadows of strife and sorrow.

### Author's Note

Welcome to the first detailed world I've created: the world of Alterhex! I will be crafting stories about individuals living in this world until I have the energy to develop the main storyline.
