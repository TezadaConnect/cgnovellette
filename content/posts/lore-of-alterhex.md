In the primordial abyss of utter darkness, where only the vast realms of time and space existed, six divine dragons emerged—beings of unimaginable power and influence. Among these were the Wind and Water Dragons, who, in their cosmic wanderings, discovered a massive boulder drifting alone in the void. The Water Dragon claimed the boulder, enveloping it entirely in a great ocean, which ignited the fury of the Wind Dragon. In retaliation, the Wind Dragon summoned torrents of earth from the heavens, shaping the land in a fierce display of power.

Their clash soon attracted the attention of the Light Dragon, the eldest and most potent of the Divines. With a burst of holy radiance, the Light Dragon blinded both adversaries, bringing an abrupt end to their battle.

In the aftermath, the Earth Dragon took the scattered remnants of dirt and crafted them into vibrant landscapes of green, with lush forests and sprawling meadows. The once barren boulder, now transformed into a fertile world, became a cradle of life.

Enthralled by the Earth Dragon’s creation, the Fire Dragon sought to leave its mark by creating a volcano. Its eruption, though spectacular, marred part of the Earth Dragon’s work. Despite the damage, the Earth Dragon, with her boundless compassion, forgave her fiery sibling.

The Light Dragon, ever proud, mocked the Fire Dragon's efforts and demonstrated true creation by crafting the sun, bathing the new world in light and warmth. The Dark Dragon, however, remained aloof, hiding in the shadows of the boulder now transformed.

Desiring living beings to cherish her creation, the Earth Dragon brought forth the elves from bamboo sprouts. These beings, endowed with a profound connection to the earth, flourished under Gaia’s favor.

The Light Dragon, intrigued by this new creation, celebrated it, while the Earth Dragon took pride in her work. The Dark Dragon remained indifferent. The Light Dragon's mocking continued as it forged an army of divine beings known as Angels, possessing immense knowledge and power.

The Fire Dragon, humbled and inspired by the Earth Dragon's success, sought guidance to create life. Over millennia, she gave birth to the most intricate and perfect beings—humans—though they were powerless, they thrived under the Fire Dragon’s nurturing love.

The remaining dragons, witnessing the rise of the elves, celestial armies, and humans, each crafted their own legions—beasts of varying forms and powers capable of great destruction.

In the midst of this divine drama, the God of Fate visited the Dark Dragon. The Dark Dragon, indifferent at first, felt the weight of fate as it began to envelop him. Despite his efforts to resist, the corruption spread, leading him to sever his own form into four parts: head, tail, left wing, and right wing. From this schism, the Demons were born.

The tainted Angels spread their corruption, leading to their expulsion from paradise by the Light Dragon. Their fall to the land created a massive crater, further destabilizing the world.

In the chaos, the Fire Dragon, determined to protect her creations, was drawn into a rift of profound darkness. The Wind Tribe beasts waged war against the Water Tribe beasts, leading to widespread devastation.

The Earth Dragon rallied guardians to protect her realm and the remaining creations of the Fire Dragon. The Light Dragon vanished, leaving a void of uncertainty.

Thus, with the intervention of the God of Fate—the World Weaver—each divine dragon and their creations were cursed, giving rise to a world of turmoil and strife. And so, Alterhex was born—a land shaped by divine struggle, fraught with conflict and hope.

### Author's Note

Welcome to the first detailed world I've created: the world of Alterhex! I will be crafting stories about individuals living in this world until I have the energy to develop the main storyline.
