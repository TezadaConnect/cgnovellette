Clanging clashes of weapons can be heard in the darkest part of the forest swamp. A muddy surface impeded anyones swift movement. The splatter of green and red blood fills the air with the scents of rust and spoiled salmon. As the moonlight filters through the dense canopy of the forest, A lady with hair that dances like flames emits a bluish colour that can take the attention of all beings including the forest swamp itself. Her skin tanned, possessing a lean athletic build. This is without doubt the presence of Shira Crescent.

---

Shira stands her ground as she clashes with the lone remaining creature. A creature with greenish malevolent eyes and limbs that are too short, which keeps the bluish-flame lady wondering, "How the fudge that this creature carries its body? ". A fat body that looks like a drum. The creature was able to fight the flaming-lady with bloodlust toe-to-toe. With its metallic tongue, it can crush a person's body with ease.

The bluish-haired lady carried a shield in her left arm to protect her from a whipping tongue of the Unique Creature Frog-men. From the name itself, it's a unique being that separates it from its peers. A creature of this calibre is bigger and five times more stronger than an ordinary creature which is commonly called a minion creature.

Shinra began to feel restless. The continuous onslaught is pinning her down in the muddy surface of the swamp. Her knees, her arm that holds the shield, are all screaming in pain. Numbing. One of her eyes was covered with a mixture of sweat and blood. Her focus was still intact. She took a solemn breath and began to monitor every whip she received. Abruptly, the tanned-lady was able to catch its metallic tongue. Her luck exceeded its limits, the tongue slid from her right fist. Well what could she expect? Tongues are made slimy after all.

The force of the pull from the tongue was heavy, Shira was pulled and lost her balance. In a flash, a whip kissed her left arm and sent an unimaginable sensation of pain, leaving her a cracking sound from her left arm bone. A sound of a shield was heard from dropping. A scream cleared the silent evening.

A slimy metallic tongue approached her in the neck. It lifts her from the ground. As the longest arm of a clock ticks, the grip gradually tightens. Shira's losing air from her lungs. Blood starts to pour from her eyes. Out of desperation, She smirked. Pulling all her strength to laugh one last time and mutter "This bastard forgot what I'm capable of". Shira ignites her right arm and holds the creature's tongue. Her eye's are in flames out of sheer gratitude. A fight till death keeps her blood boiling. The ignition of her arm frost the tip of the metallic whip.

The creature shows incredible intelligence. It cuts its own tongue to save itself from the spreading chill. Shira's bottom limbs soon reach the muddy ground. She put an extreme effort to break the grip from her neck and took a deep breath. She launched herself forward with incredible speed, hurtling like a cannonball towards the source of the floppy footsteps created by the obese creature. It was trying to escape. Her fiery flaming hand reached its back-belly and froze it. With her strength alone, The belly shattered into crystalline shards, the sound of its destruction echoing through the air. With a disoriented frame, the unique creature landed in the mud. Shira, consumed by fury, delivered another crushing blow to its face, shattering its eyes. With merciless resolve, she proceeded to break each of its tiny, once-cute limbs, inflicting further devastation upon the helpless creature.She continued her onslaught against the creature for 30 relentless minutes, ceaseless in her abominable actions until it drew its final breath, its last gasp of life expended.

The adrenaline departed from Shira's beautiful body. Agonising pain surged through her very being, causing her to bleed profusely, yet she is far from losing consciousness. She stared into the moon. Gritting her teeth. A radiant white light emanated from her frame, suffusing her with its healing energy. The light tenderly healed her shallow wounds, offering solace from the biting cold of her freezing power. And also from the chilling curse of the moon.

[Memoir Glyph: You ascended to Asimi rank]

Shira gritted her teeth and gasped. "I was about to cry, from receiving a damn pouch". She laughed and added "At-least I ascended to Asimi... That felt better." The blue-haired lady pampered herself, denying that she almost died just to get a damn pouch.

---

Shira lifted herself from the ground and moved towards the edge of the swamp. There She followed a curved path. Even though her wounds had healed through ascension, she still felt the sting from her broken bone. She moved her right arm to comfort the paining limb. As she followed the flow of the curve, a horde of steps was heard approaching. White capes billowing. silverish armour gleaming. The group was unmistakably the official cohorts. The strongest party who had built the guild from scratch. Gritting her teeth, holding her broken arm, Shira maintained her speed.

The cohort paused, their gazes locking onto her. A man broke the silence, commanding one of his people, "Assess the whole swamp." With a swift nod, the man darted towards the swamp, leaving no trace behind. Shira observed as a lady with blonde hair and beautiful dark eyes approached the man in command. "Dexor, the one in front of us is Shira Crescent, a Xylo rank night dweller," she reported. Shira smirked at the reaction of the cohort members, feeling a thrill at the unfolding events.

Her soul leapt for joy as a man approached Dexor. Shira stared at the pathetic figure, panting before Dexor and said, "Lord Dexor... Five hundred fifty-six frog-men and a Unique Creature were wiped out in the swamp." Shira's smile turned creepy, her eyes gleaming with malice. She relished the darkness within, hidden behind her facade of innocence.

The tanned lady heard the cohort's amused voices, "Wow!!! What!!! No way!!! This woman is crazy!" As she enjoyed the scene, her thoughts murmured, "You all are pathetic losers, grouping together to save your own asses." Shira then remarked in her thoughts, "You people are a bunch of Asimi rankers leeching off each other." With a sigh, she followed, "Dexor, Dexor, Dexor... I can't wait to see your face being betrayed by your comrades."

She tilted her eyes to catch a glimpse of this pathetic leader of the cohort. The tanned lady was stunned by what she saw, sending shivers down her spine. Quickly averting her gaze back to the ground, she hastened her pace.
A voice abruptly broke her momentum. "Shira..." The mere sound of it made Shira's legs tremble. She muttered to herself, "Is he angry with me? What on earth was that?"

Gritting her teeth, she thought, "What now? I gave you the Unique Corrupted Monster that lies beyond the swamp. I'm retreating, you see."

Suddenly, a horde of clanging sounds caught Shira's ears. Obligated. She turned her face behind her. There, she saw all the cohorts kneeling down behind her.

Once again, a heart-shattering voice caught Shira off guard. "We, the Silver Raven Cohorts, express our gratitude for the path you have carved for us," the voice resonated. Shira, still refining her steel heart, remained composed.
Dexor, once more, pleaded, "I, Dexor, will honour your display of strength to the guild."

Joy, sadness, disgust, surprise, anger, and fear. Shira experienced all six primary emotions in under a minute. Steadying herself, she resumed her walk home. She regained her composure. She reminisced about the expression she had seen on Dexor's face. His features were cloaked in dark shadows, and his eyes glowed with a perfectly circular white light. Shira gritted her teeth and thought, "That is not the face of a leader. It's the face of a tyrant!"

Starlight gently illuminates the path leading towards a leaning building. Adjacent to this structure stands another kind of edifice, providing support. Sharp shards of glass encase every window of both buildings, glistening in the faint light. The area is littered with crumpled vehicles and scattered craters from large fallen bricks, creating a scene of desolation and decay.

BGC, once a hive of activity, now lies eerily quiet, drained of hope. Among the remnants of chaos, two towering buildings stand tall. It is the place Shira longs to reach. These structures are her haven. A peace around a place ruined by violence.

Shira walked towards the two lovely buildings. Between them was an alley. Beneath the hollow bricks, there was a passage leading to the underground levels of these structures. There, the dining area awaited her, seemingly ready for her arrival. A man was sitting across the table. Shira approached, pulled out a chair, and sat down.
A welcoming voice greeted her, "Good evening, my daughter. How was your adventure today?"

The tanned lady met the man's gaze with indifferent eyes. The man spoke again, "I feel like something was stolen from you."

Shira sighed. Then lowering her gaze to her food, she replied "I ascended to Asimi rank a while ago".

The man's right eyebrow arched as he whispered with a smile, "Isn't that good news?" He took Shira's spoon, dug into her share of food, and then lifted the spoon towards her lips. He coaxed "Come on, little girl, eat."

Obligated. Shira grabbed the tip of the spoon with her mouth, her face contorted in a look of defiant irritation.
Shira tilted her eyes towards the man's face. He was her father. Abruptly, her dad's lips flattened, and looked down. She felt a pang of regret for her actions. Worried, she asked, "Come on, Dad, why so serious today?"

Her father gave a slight, unsettling smile that really bothered her. He then asked, "Are you still taking on tasks solo? Why not start joining a party?"

A clanging sound was heard as Shira's fork fell to the floor. Offended. Her ears are growing warm. The lady took a deep breath and shouted, "And what? Let myself get killed like Mom?" Her voice rang out, loud and filled with fury, as she directed her anger at her father.

---

The events of the first wave, four months ago, were still vividly fresh in her mind. Like Shira, her mom was a fighter-type dweller too. Back then, her mom was one of the protectors and the leader of their so-called pact. To end the first wave, they had to eliminate two hostile, uniquely corrupted creatures. Their plan was to engage the bosses for weeks, putting stress on creatures' joints until their limbs could no longer move.

Shira worshipped her mom with pride. On the day her mom's cohort confronted the first wave's abominations, Shira was tasked with helping her father and other utility-type dwellers during the siege. Among the minors, she was the fiercest. She was also the person tasked to deliver supplies to the battlefield. Her mom's cohort forbade anyone below 18 from entering the battle, and Shira was just one month shy of the legal age. As the sun kissed the western part of the sky, she ran swiftly to approach her mom, knowing she was resting at that moment.

Yet, what revealed itself in front of her were craters, chunks of bricks, fire, blood, corpses, and her mom fighting the abominations alone. The sight blew her mind with confusion. She recognized all the corpses scattered on the ground. The horrifying view triggered one thought in her mind: the people lying on the ground had been forsaken. The corpses were all the sunlit dwellers of her mom's cohort!

There were two kinds of dwellers as far as she knew: the Sunlit dwellers, who harnessed their full potential under the sun, and the Moonlit dwellers, who thrived under the moon. Unlike Shira, her mom was a Sunlit dweller. These corpses, and her mom, were supposed to be resting while the Moonlit dwellers dealt with the two abominations.

Instead, she saw her mom, missing one of her calves and supported by a piece of wood, her right arm immobile, and her entire body drenched in blood. Shira watched in horror as her mom went toe-to-toe with the two first wave bosses.

Suddenly, she whispered, "Mom, just run..." Her eyes started to feel heavy. "You have to rest..." Those words were meant to be screamed, yet she couldn't out of fear. She tried and tried to scream, but only the clashing of weapons filled the air.

The night ended with a dim lavender-ish light, casting an otherworldly glow over the land. The eyes of all surviving humans widened in disbelief as an eerie screen of visuals appeared in the heavens, capturing the attention of all, drawing gazes from place to place.

[Memoir Glyph Broadcast]

First Wave Completed

Top Contributor

Datu Mayari: Shira Crescent

Clearing Time: 1 week, 5 days, and 19 hours

Next Wave Arrival: In 60 days

Realising what she had done, Shira followed with an apologetic reply, "Sorry... I was just frustrated today, Dad." She glanced at her dad's face, seeing him biting his lips. Shira knew that her dad was simply worried about her, and the events of the past still ached for both of them.

The two minutes of silence were broken by Shira as she asked her father, "Dad, have you ever met Dexor?" The man shifted his gaze to meet hers, his eyebrows arching upward, and replied, "Yes, dear. I'm his official chef, after all."

Her dad, a utility-type dweller, may not be capable of fighting, but his culinary soul abilities are undeniable. He has the ability to produce dishes that enhance regeneration and toughen defences for any dweller. This is the reason why her mom's cohort was able to withstand almost two weeks of non-stop onslaught. They were nourished and fortified by his cooking.

Shira took a deep breath, her face painted with a serious expression. She stated firmly "I saw him and the cohort on my way here."

Her father's lips curled into a mischievous smile and teased her, "Hmmm... seems like someone here found her mate."
Feeling embarrassment creeping up, Shira sensed warmth flooding her ears. She protested in a forceful whisper, "Dad! It's not what you think!"

The man's expression turned sinister. His tone is serious. He asked, "I know, I know. What is it that you want to know?"

Shira sighed and confided in her dad, "It seems that he could kick a goat out of whim..."

Her dad straightened his lips and said, "Shira... Dexor is just a boy who's so busy that he has no time to kid around."

Using her mental strength, Shira replied, "I felt that it wasn't the case." Then she realised something was missing and asked, "Speaking of GOAT, where's Nimple the Eighth?"

She saw her dad's face turn in the right direction. He tilted his eyes to the ceiling, puckered his lips, and began whistling. Shira's eyes widened, her heart pounding fast. She screamed loudly, "Don't tell me this stew is Nimple VIII?!"

Philippines. A country known for its kind people and constant smiles. Boasts with famous beaches, caves, and other breathtaking wonders. It is also renowned for its abundant agriculture and livestock. Well, not anymore. After a wave of turmoil swept through the nation's cities, people began to desperately search for food. Fights broke out over scarce resources, with some individuals taking control of malls and grocery stores, claiming them as their territories. As the food supply dwindled and items reached their spoilage dates, desperation grew. People continued to consume whatever they could find, hoping to stave off the relentless hunger gnawing at their bellies.

There stood Shira, choking her father in fury, her heart filled with disdain as she spat out, "This is the eighth time you've cooked my pet!" Her father, unable to speak, struggled in the heated confrontation with his enraged daughter.

Shira was always fascinated by goats. Years ago, her dad's hometown was filled with polled goats, and she eagerly fed them every morning. Shira studied their behaviours like a mad scientist, observing every detail. After feeding them in the morning, she noticed the goats would move towards grassy areas. She marvelled at their unbelievable stomach capacity. Able to consume vast amounts of food without hesitation.

In the afternoon, she offered water mixed with chaff to the goats. What intrigued her the most was their behaviour afterward: after drinking, the goats would immediately seek out the hottest areas, basking in the direct sunlight. This led her to conclude that goats are averse to getting wet.

Lying on the ground, the polled goats were typically engrossed in their munching. Shira observed with fascination as they chewed and swallowed their food, a natural process to her. However, what truly captured her attention was their ability to regurgitate the food and chew it again. It seemed like an endless cycle of sustenance to her.

Shira often seized this opportunity to sneak up on the goats, launching her playful attacks by hugging them tightly. It was during these moments that the alpha male of the herd would watch her, his eyes betraying a mixture of curiosity and concern as she brought her playful antics to their kin. And finally, the moment she had been waiting for arrived: a chance to wrestle with the strongest goat head-on.

Since then, she had taken a goat as her pet, not only because of its adorable eyes but simply because it was a GOAT—Greatest Of All Time! She named her first goat pet Nimple, but her dad kept using it as an ingredient in their dishes. Frustrated and disheartened, the night ended with Shira lying alone in her cold chamber's bed, trying to sleep with a heavy heart.

The sun launched itself from the east, casting its golden rays upon Shira as she stood before an imposing structure. The tanned lady's skin radiate warmth, and her blue hair shimmered in the morning light. Her eyes absorbed the reflections of colours emitted by the building. Its walls, a hollow grey, appeared fresh from drying cement, while the yellowish light inside glowed through the large, rectangular windows. Within, the inhabitants were clearly engrossed in their discussions. Despite the calamity of the moon wave cataclysm, the building seemed unaffected, retaining its modern, minimalist design.

She eagerly pushed open the structure's cosy glass door. The dwellers inside glanced up at her entrance, then quickly returned to their business. From across the room, she heard a man in a polo shirt whisper, "Hey, is that Shira? The one who faced off against over five hundred frog-men and a Unique Creature all alone?!"

The bald man next to him hurriedly shushed him. "Shhh, you know what? She can hear you!"

Unsurprisingly. Shira maintained a smile as bright as the sky. She walked confidently towards a white freelance work board, positioned at the corner of the wooden internal designed building. Recycled papers can be seen, bursting with details of every requested job. Hang like a colourful tapestry across the board. Most of it was a mundane task for her. Shira continued to move her eyes from left to right. Seeking a job suited for her. After minutes of reading, finally. She found one.

Job: Eliminate All Kobolds in the Sagada Forest

Description: Several Xylo-ranked newbies have gone missing or returned injured. Assistance is requested to clear out the suspected kobold nests in Sagada Cave.

Sole Rank Requirement: At Least with an Asimi rank dweller in a party

Request From: Dexor Aitken, Leader of the Silver Raven Cohort

Reward: 20 Regolith Ore

Shira laughed loudly, disrupting everyone's business. She then carefully took the job notice. Her mind drifted to the reward. As she daydreamed, someone approached her, snapping her back to reality that annoyed her.

A group of dwellers, consisting of two people, approached her. The man in the group smiled and greeted her, "Lady Shira, good morning... We are in need of one more dweller for our task..."

Shira greeted them with a reluctant expression and said, "Ah, morning... You see, I'm busy."

The guy, wearing a ragged dark plain shirt, appeared young and naive. Despite Shira's reluctance, he continued to pursue her, saying, "No worries, this will happen five days from now." He then followed up with a question, "We can make time, right?"

This irritated Shira, making her ears warm with disgust. She decided to offer the guy in the ragged shirt a deal and said, "Alright, but first help me with this." Shira moved her hand toward the boy's face, showing him the job request paper she had chosen.

The boy paused for a moment, his eyes scanning the paper before him. Shira felt a prickling sensation at the back of her neck as she sensed the boy's gaze shifting towards her. With a forced smile, the ragged boy finally agreed, sending a wave of regret washing over her.

Beside him, the young girl reached out and took his hand, her lips down-turned in a frown. "Brother," she murmured, her voice filled with concern, "That's an Asimi Rank task..."

People in the building nearby widened their eyes, a hushed murmur spreading among them. "So she was an Asimi rank? No wonder."

Shira felt a surge of determination as she sought to capitalise on the situation, her desperation palpable. She hurried after the ragged boy and leaned in close, her voice urgent. "You... your sister is right, this task is very, very dangerous," she emphasised, hoping to instil some doubt.

Shira believes that the dwellers around Dexor's guild were nothing but a bunch of scaredy-cats. But then again, who wouldn't be scared? These people lived in the lap of comfort tasks, sheltered from the harsh realities she faced daily.

The boy's gaze shifted to his sister, his expression serious. "Fae, we have to do this to progress," he stated firmly. His sister furrowed her brow, her lips tilting slightly as she contemplated his words.

Sitting within the confines of the karatela, Shira found herself engulfed by its verdant embrace, her regrets echoing within its leafy sanctuary. Not only was she forced herself to create a party, but the prospect of having to split the reward equally among them weighed heavily on her mind. Lost in her contemplation, she was startled when a voice cut through the silence.

"Lady Shira... I want to introduce myself..." The words snapped her out of her reverie, and she turned her gaze lazily towards the ragged-shirted boy, her expression betraying none of the turmoil raging within her.

The ragged boy's lips curved upward as he introduced himself, his voice carrying a hint of pride. He declared "I am Maharlika: Rekko, a sunlit dweller," With a subtle flourish, he demonstrated his ability to shape metallic substances, although Shira seemed disinterested, her attention elsewhere.

"I can mould metallic substances around the area," he explained, the flicker of excitement evident in his eyes as he continued, "This karatela is made with my ability."

Observing Rekko's impressive ability, Shira couldn't help but acknowledge its potential. With enough training and refinement, she mused, he could likely hold his own against formidable monsters without fear of retaliation. It was a quality she found herself admiring, particularly because it was something she lacked – a strong defensive capability. It became the first thing she noted about him, recognizing its value in their upcoming challenges.

A girl's voice faltered as she spoke, her words stumbling out. "I'm Maharlika: Fae... um, we're both Xylo rank... we... we're in your care... Lady Shira." Shira's gaze hardened with disdain as she regarded Fae, her thoughts filled with frustration. She lamented inwardly, grappling with the realisation of the companions fate had thrust upon her. "Dang it! How did I end up here?

---

Shira's party landed in the Sagada forest. They were greeted by towering trees and an embrace of a fresh breeze, a gift from Mother Nature herself. Unlike the ruined cities in Metro Manila, this sanctuary seems untouched by civilization.

The Sagada Forest is rich in herbs and precious metals, well, no one dares to enter the place. The cave is the root cause of it. It was a good lair for monsters. Every month this area is purged by an Asimi rank dweller, most of those dwellers are from the official cohorts. Shira wondered why they asked from an outside source like them to do the chore. Maybe they have an expedition or raid? Who knows, all she needed to do now was step in and drive those rascals out of their comfort zone.

The ragged boy Rekko began disassembling the kartela, unwavering it with his soul ability.

The girl seems to knock on the mechanically moving object. The moving object was the one pulling the kartela. It is a machine that resembles the mighty looks and speed of a horse. The once-golden bronze horse became grey and dead. The mechanical features of it were taken out by an eerie light that flowed towards Fae.

Shira, from afar, observed the two in a sceptical manner. She saw Rekko reach for the grey statue horse. The statue began to reshape. Two huge arms and tiny lower limbs, each moulded in two large long metal-like pebbles. These limbs were connected to a large piece of metal that resembled a torso. A cylindrical shape can also be seen in the upper part of the chunk metal.

Shira then mutes in the distance, her eyes filled with fascination "It's like a metalic-golem!"

Fae moves to reach the golem. Touching the hard, clanky torso. She began to cast the weird light again. There, Shira saw the phenomenon she'd only seen in movies. The golem turns into a junk golden bronze, moving as if it has a battery that sustains its energy needs. It looks like it was invented in the era of tinkerers. Each motion does take the cogs surrounded by its shoulder joint spinning fast. The once-cylinder pebble became a face, a flat feature constructed with two glowing blue lights that indicate its eyes.

Rekko, on the other hand, gathered all the minerals around him. He then moulded it into a huge-shaped plate. In his right hand, a long, sharp, pointy object has been moulded too. He looks like an Athens warrior in Greek mythology, holding a huge shield and sword.

The two then faced Shira in a thoughtful, determined manner and said, "Lady Shira, we're locked and loaded."
Shira was amused by the two creeps, unable to say a word, and nodded.

---

The group reached the middle of the forest. Shira sensed danger around them. These rascals were trying to ambush her team; She could sense it in her bones. Abruptly, a kobold with a sword was flying towards her, aiming to pierce her with force. Yet Shira was perplexed. The momentum of the attack seemed too slow. Her eyes scanned the vicinity in complete detail, as if time itself is slowing down.

To counter the aggression, she bent her knees, forming a runner's position. She then leaped forward, leaving the ground with a crater-like mark from the force of her takeoff, breaking the ground beneath her. She twisted her lean body mid-air, narrowly avoiding the kobold's pointy object. Bluish fire started to ignite on her hand, indicating an imminent defying-gravity force will be about to inflict. Her fiery fist landed squarely on the kobold's jaw. As the kobold's jaw caught her fist, its body continued in the direction it had been going, while its head was forcibly guided by Shira's punch. Unable to withstand the tremendous force, the kobold's head burst into pieces.

Blood drenched the tanned lady's face and upper body as the kobold's body continued to roll on the ground.
Meanwhile, the two siblings painted a grimace on their faces. The circumstance was a glimpse before both of them could react.

Meanwhile, Shira was devastated. She smelled like a dog now, covered in blood. She regretted not freezing the kobold's head first before smashing it to pieces. Still, her mind struggled to process what was happening. Her strength was unlike anything she had experienced before. She suspected that ascending into Asimi rank was the cause of this sudden surge of power. Shinra Smirked and laughed loudly!

Shira then commanded the two to get ready.

The predicament brought such unease that it cleared the air. A hushed, rustling grass echoed in the solemn space. Kobolds began to surround them. Shira scans the approaching horde, counting, "One, two, three hundred!". Satisfied with the assessment, Shira ignited her fiery blue fists once more.

In a relentless onslaught, the kobolds found themselves pushed back by the three visitors. The huge machinery is on offence, bringing an intense labour force to crush the kobolds. Rekko covered the blind spot of Shira and guarding Fae at the same time. Both the two seemed exasperated as Shira glimpsed at them. She speculated that the two either have low stamina or their power adheres too much control.

Shira then aimed at the current matter and met each assailant head-on, beating them soundly and leaving a trail of broken bodies in her wake. She pierced the kobolds flesh and tortured them by snapping their limbs until, finally, they stood at the entrance of Sagada Cave.

The visitors continued to walk. Their movements were cautious yet purposeful. Pausing at the threshold, Shira surveyed their surroundings with curiosity. To her surprise, there were no kobolds lurking within the cavern.
Shira's team proposes to move forward in the depths of the cave. In the depths of the cave, the party was left in astonishment. A serendipitous discovery!

What they saw was a vast cavern with greenish, moss-covered rock formations. A boulder that resembles a plateau with grass on top, located in the middle, is roughly the size of a kartela.

A shallow pond that surrounds the boulder can be seen. The pond-flowing nature filled the air with a soothing trickling noise.

The sunshine streamed through a huge crater in the ceiling, illuminating the cavern's ecosystem.
Shira's jaw almost hit the ground, and she yelled, "No wonder monsters keep f\*cking around here!"

---

Rekko and Fae sank onto a comfortable rock formation in the cavern, taking their time to regain their energy. They appreciated the beauty of the sunlight peeking through the crater in the cavern's ceiling.

Shira couldn't afford the comfort the cavern offered them, discerning creepy variation around the vicinity. Her eyes darted from place to place. A glyph on the cave wall caught her attention: a fiery lion, a serpent, an eagle, and a king crab. Pendants resembling the sun, a human receiving sunlight.

Shira lost her concentration. A voice broke the silence, saying, "Lady Shira, let's have lunch." She tilted her head toward the source of the voice and replied, "Just a moment, I'm reading something."

Rekko moved forward, squinting in the direction Shira was watching, his lips raised on both sides, and said, "Lady Shira, you must be hungry." He added, "There are no symbols or texts there."

Shira raised an eyebrow, took a deep breath, and thought. Could a human have drawn this glyph before the cataclysmic event occurred? How could this person understand and draw something that only dwellers like her can read? And why can only she see it?

Her mind buzzed with questions that had no answers. With a thoughtful, determined look, she replied, "I must be seeing things." Her lips raised both sides and she added, "Alright, let's eat!"

As Shira advanced toward Fae, Rekko led the way, guiding her steps. Following his path, a shiver ran down her spine, alerting her to potential danger. A chilling breeze swept through the cave, sending ominous signals through her body. The cave quivered slightly, echoing a heavy stomp. From a short distance away, a blue-flamed creature revealed itself. Its slender body, long flaming limbs, and legs bending in opposite directions resembled a thunderbolt. Squinting, she attempted to recognize its head, but then realisation struck her like a lightning bolt.

"A horse!" she screamed, terror gripping her voice.

The abominations mane glowed with a hot bluish flame, illuminating the darkest parts of the cave. Abruptly, the darkness began to succumb to the eerie light, leaving no trace of the creature. In shock, Shira took a glimpse from any direction. In a flash, the creature stretched its arm back to cleave at her. The damn horse was in front of her. Long reach. Fast. And its shadow covers Shira's whole body. It was a unique, corrupted moon-were-horse.

Shira's legs went numb, trembling before the abomination. But she quickly regained her nerve. This was what she had signed up for—an intense battle to the death. A smirk spread across her face, relishing every pounding second. Not to get beaten, but to beat the wall out of her way.

She moved to dodge the creature's deadly strike but hesitated. Instead, she ignited her fiery fist and made a decisive blow. A fang for a fang. She struck the creature's frame, frosting it with her soul ability, and shattered it with her latent inhuman strength. Before the creature could howl in despair, Shira was sent flying and smashed through the cave wall.

The two siblings flinched at the shattering crash echoing nearby. The instance was so sudden that at least the sound of the lighting was one of the fastest to capture the moment. The enormous, slender creature then growled in agony.

Shira gritted her teeth and screamed, "You two, retreat!"

The tanned lady leaned against the cave walls, trying to lift herself up for the hunt. Gasping. Blood burst from her mouth after gritting her teeth.

But the unique corrupted moon were-horse was already in front of her. Her knees collapsed to the ground as she gasped for breath. Pale and bleeding. Her arm was disoriented. Every breath was a toll on her clinging life. Her ribs were broken. Kneeling on the ground with dark thoughts. She muttered, "For damn sake, why would it appear at lunchtime when I'm at my weakest?" She felt dizzy and kept wondering, "Am I dying?". Her teeth gritted in agony.

Afterwards, her lips cast a farewell raise at both ends, and said, "I hate mom's cooking!"

She closed her eyes and tilted her lips in satisfaction. Abruptly, a noise filled the air—a clang of a weapon that surged into her soul. Shira's vision blurred, revealing a hazy scene. Someone stood there, protecting her, just like her mother once did. It was bright as light, clad in flaming, massive armour adorned with lion heads on the shoulders. A helmet strapped over their entire face, with glowing yellow eyes illuminating the darkness in front.

It was noon—the time of day when a sunlit dweller is at their fullest potential. A sudden call broke through her dizzy state: "Lady Shira! " The flaming blue beast struck, pinning the person down with its long arm. The voice came again: "Come on, take this to lessen the pain and flee with Fae." Shira took the tablet, determined, and swallowed it without hesitation. She regained her footing and fixed her disoriented arm. On a whim, Shira replied, "You should have fled and left me behind, Rekko." The boy smiled at her and said, "It's okay. Protecting the princess is my honour, and I'll die with that glory." He then aimed his sight at the unique corrupted moon were-horse, prepared to clash with the abomination.

Shira seized the opportunity and accelerated. She bent her knees like an Olympic champion and surged forward with haste. Rekko, for the last time, commanded her, "Go! Tell my tale, Shira Crescent, warrior of the western sea! "
Shira reached Fae and hoisted the girl onto her shoulder, face backward. She felt something wet against her back. Determined to comfort Fae, she said, "Don't cry, princess." She gritted her teeth and added, "It's normal for a warrior."

Shira's mind swirled with questions. The unique corrupted moon werehorse should have been dead—a creature she slaughtered months ago, the boss of the first wave along with the unique corrupted sun sarangay. Why was it in this current wave? Where was the Sarangay? Were they supposed to revive in later waves? Her quest for answers was interrupted by a fragile whisper of sorrow: "Why are we always running?"

Shira's momentum faltered as the girl solemnly protested, "Are we not allowed to rest?"

After a minute of solemnity, Shira broke her speed and gently placed the girl on the cave floor. She turns swiftly, Accelerating back towards the lone crusader. Her mind turned dark, and her eyes were heavy with fatigue. Shira moved mindlessly towards Rekko, who was now on his knees. The abomination before the crusader loomed, suggesting an assault on eternal slumber. As surging water from a dam crossed her face, she muttered, "Why do I keep running towards danger?"

It happened again, just like before. Her mother's final plea urged her to flee. Her intuition screamed for escape, yet she had reached for a shield to confront the Unique Creature Frogmen. And now, a boy with cult-like beliefs has echoed the same plea for flight. Her thoughts crystallised, forming a bridge that connected them all. Her mother, the crusader, and herself—all had sought protection, but none had found it.

A mist started to flow on her lips, and it all became clear. Her mother's final plea, Rekko's desperate command, and her own unyielding resolve were all intertwined. They were all searching for safety in a world that offered none. Shira's grip tightened, her resolve hardening as she whispered to herself, "We protect, because no one else will."

A choice had to be made in this dire situation. A strange wind surrounded Shira, blending with the cold-cast ignition. Her ground glowed as freezing fire scattered towards her lower extremities. Her hands emitted the same glow, spreading up her arms. Shira sighed, releasing an extremely cloudy mist. The were-horse stared at her and assumed a defensive stance. As Shira's assault landed on the abomination, its long arms frosted over and were sent flying. The clanging sound was immediately overtaken by a howl of agony.

Shira's grip twisted the metal armour, crumpling it. With a yank, she pulled Rekko clear of the abomination's reach. The crusader boy coughed, his breaths ragged. Blood and rust filled the air—a vile stench. Rekko furrowed his brow, his lips pressed tight in a grimace. He rasped, "I told you to escape, Lady Shira!".

Shira's eyes, hardening with a steely glint of determination, met his gaze. A fierce grin, all sharp corners and defiance, tugged at her lips. She countered her voice ringing with a challenge. "Then what? Let you have all the glory?!"

---

Rekko's armour was gripped by the tanned lady at the far end of the cave.

Shira breathes, releasing a smoking freeze. The area around her seems blurry from the mist. The crusader echoed near her and asked, "So, what's the plan?" Shira tilted her head and gazed at Rekko immediately, then turned back, facing the were-horse. Determined to end the predicament, she said, "Did you know the tale of Tikbalang?" Answered by silence, she added, "Tikbalang has a golden thread on their mane. If a person was able to get that, the Tikbalang will follow that person's command."

Rekko reached for the ground to stabilise himself and said, "So we need to get that single thread?"
Shira's lips lowered on both sides and she replied, "Supposedly, but that damn were-horse has three." Sweat dropped in her eyebrow and she added, "And only a moon dweller can touch its fiery mane." Her head tilted to sight Rekko, and she saw him widen his eyes from the broken helm. The boy gripped his weapon and asked, "How do you know this stuff?"

Shira pondered the outcome of her mother's battle during the first wave. It appeared that her mom's arm had become immobile; it was not crushed but was burned. The scene continued with her mom trying to go behind the moon were-horse. Shira seized that clue. She also remembers her mom enthusiastically loved hearing folk tales from her mother-in-law–Shira's paternal grandmother. Her mom was truly a genius, able to decipher such things.
Yet the sun-sarangay clubbed her mom. Blown into pieces by the force.

It was because of her. Her mom sensed her presence and urged her to flee, but her mom found herself losing track of the current situation. Shira couldn't erase that from her thoughts. It was so sudden.

At that moment, a flight wasn't an option for her either. She fought those abominations for a full two hours. Only to realise the clue. It took a broken fist and an injured knee joint for her to retrieve those three threads.
Meanwhile, it took her one hour to erase the sun-sarangay from existence. That bastard made her rewind a lecture in her craft class.

The tale of Sarangay was that it always guarded its treasure; if someone tried to steal it, then it would haunt the person wherever they were in the four corners of the world.

Yes, that bastard made Shira construct a satin bracelet out of the golden thread. She could have also died at that moment if it wasn't evening.

However, today's predicament was different. Maintaining forty percent of her power takes a toll on her life. She raised her lips on both ends with pride and told the crusader boy, "I beat that damn were-horse to pulp for about three hours in the first wave." She then flattened her lips and added, "Look at that were-horse arm and torso; it should have been dead! That bastard will only regenerate after 30 minutes."

Rekko squinted his eyes towards the abomination and said, "I'm grateful, Lady Shira; I would have died without knowing."

Shira proceeded with her lecture on the were-horse. This abomination has a three-attack pattern. A wide-arm slap can break a person's skeletal system in one swipe. Its chasing ability appears unstoppable, leaving no one able to escape. Lastly, the twisting kick has the potential to launch a person into the celestial realm upon impact. Her experience with this creature seems undeniable, yet her strength at noon can only make it worse. Determined. Shira spat out a command to the crusader boy: "Rekko, occupy that damn were-horse." Shira's lips raised on one side, she smirked, and she added, "It's been a while; I miss your damn golden hair."

Shira, at full speed, rushes toward the abomination. Her intuition suggests a glide between legs. A chilling, crackling vibration overtook the grievous atmosphere. Shira cast an ice-cold flame on the floor that spread rapidly and frost-covered the horse's feet.

Her thoughts marvelled at the extent of her new-found power since ascending to the Asimi rank. At forty percent, she could freeze anyone in her path with a mere glance. It was a newly acquired soul ability she obtained after rank-up.

[Arctic Moon Wolf]: Those who possess the blood of the descendants are adorned by the dim light of the moon. Transform the caster into a guardian of darkness.

Shira possessed two soul abilities in her arsenal. Both of these soul abilities annoyed her. Her first soul ability, the [Dance of the Tribe], made her unable to use weapons in exchange for a fiery fist that can frost anything it touches in a mere wink. The second soul ability was a useless soul attack; she doesn't even bother to explore. Now that she is an Asimi ranker, she has a new soul ability at her disposal.

Shira glides beneath the lower limbs of the were-horse. The now-icy surface of the cave made it possible. Shira gritted her teeth and stabilised her ground. She leaps onto the abomination's spine, securing her legs around the lumbar region. Her determination enabled her to find the first thread. Without hesitation, she extracted it from the fiery mane with ease.

The were-horse roared in fury, caught her bluish hair, and yanked it vertically. Fixating her attention on the ache in her head, she tightly gripped her thighs against the body of the abomination. Shira reached for the force's grip and ignited her hand, freezing it. But instead, she dropped both of her hands out of exhaustion; this was the cost she must pay for overusing her power at noon. Her sense of sight began to dwindle as the pull in her head got rougher. Her strength slowly fails her.

Abruptly, a strong jolt from the abomination's body shook Shira's head. As she regained her bearings, she noticed a portion of a rod near the creature's chest. It was a moment of rest that Shira needed. She gritted her teeth and forced her hands to extract the second thread.

The abomination echoed a roar that made Shira lose the ability to hear. The creature releases its grip from the bluish hair of the lady. It then stretches its limb behind to cleave. Shira reduced its cleave power, by holding onto its arm. Yet, it's still powerful. A rod can be seen in mid-air, it was a hammer, along with a full arm. The crusader boy was sent to the corner of the cave, missing an upper limb. The creature smashed the ground. Releasing its foot from being frozen. Its limb began to repel the sticky person behind by crushing Shiras feet.

The abomination's roar reverberated, rendering Shira deaf. It released its grip on the bluish hair of the lady. The creature then extended its limb behind it to deliver a cleaving strike. Shira tries to reduce its cleaving power by holding onto its arm. Yet, it's still overwhelming.

Shira starred in mid-air. She witnessed the rod unveiled itself as an enormous hammer of the crusader. Rekko was stuck to the cave wall in a flash, missing his arm. A rusty stench overwhelmed the area.

Unconcluded, the creature smashed the ground, releasing its foot from being frozen. Its limb extended toward the lady's feet and crushed them in the process.

A scream of agony cleared the air. Her face contorted, and her jaw clenched so tightly that the veins on her neck stood out. Shira was forced to release her lower limbs from the abomination's lower abdomen. She was then greeted by a grip that threw her mid-air. Gasping. Shira saw an oval-shaped object approaching her. Determined to cling to her life, she raised her arm to brace for an imminent impact.

The twisting kick reached her arm mid-air. The collision made her limb immobile. Shira was dispatched to the cavern wall. Unable to taste the air out of distress.

Her exhausted body kissed the cave floor. Her sight has blurred. Shapes were moving. A pair of white, thick columns and fabric hanging, asymptotically reaching the floor, seems to have appeared. Her vision grew dimmer and dimmer, and she gasped, "I failed my team, f\*ck!" Her sight swallowed by darkness, she added, "Provide me one more chance, please." She raised her lips in one end, smirked, and thought, "If we ever get reincarnated, I'll make sure to win."

---

A voice echoing from near space saying, “Lady Sh... Lady Shira.”

Shira’s ears ring loudly as she tries to squint her eyes after regaining consciousness from her slumber. There she saw Rekko, who made his hand with a bandana that blocked the sight of Fae.

Meanwhile, Rekko looks like a tomato. His eyes glared down. He then stuttered and muttered, “There… There's a minor here, Lady… Lady Shira. Please refrain from your action.”

Shira raises a brow, trying to make sense of the situation.

It has been awhile since the last time she slept with pillows. Not only that, but the pillow has a unique fragrance too. However, it also feels hard. What kind of pillow is this?

Shira lifted her head slightly, enabling her to twist her head to catch a glimpse of the said pillow. Her eyes see a bulging white column. Moreover, she draws her attention to its extension.

A dark, ominous face with two perfect circles of white light eyes got her off her guard. The being sounded concerned, He asked, “How are you?”

The light of karatela illuminates the dark face of the being. It was Dexor, with tanned skin, obsidian-haired, and clad in white plates. His right lip ends in a dark bruise.

Shira erupted with laughter upon seeing Dexor’s swelling face. Her eyes sparkled in tears, and she said, “What happened to your face? ”She continued her laughter, infecting Fae and Rekko. As her last laugh died, her eyes drew a determination to ask what happened. The inside of karatela’s light atmosphere shifted.

Rekko flattened his lips and said, “Lady Shira, please allow us to leave the party.”

Shira flattened her lips. Frowning. Her eyes gaze at the boy's new clanky limb. It was the fruit of her incompetence.

The boy added, “We will not take our share... Fae and I will be joining the official cohort.”

Shira made a sour face, contorted her brows, and said, “What?! Did this guy bribe you?”

The boy replied in silence, his lips tilted low.

The man on the white plate calmly asked, “You have objections?” Everyone inside the karatela glares at him.
Rekko, with a forced whisper, told Shira, “My mission is to protect Princess Fae. It’s logical for me to accept Captain Dexor’s invitation. I apologise, Lady Shira.”

The man on the white plate gazed at Shira, raising his obsidian brow, and told her, “You're not into group activities; this isn't something that concerns you.”

Shira felt warm in her ears out of embarrassment. Her hand was cramped. Igniting her fist, she commanded Dexor, “I challenge you in a duel... I’ll make sure that these fools made the correct choice.”

Dexor widens his eyes in dismay. He sighs heavily and says, “Got it!”

---

The karatela jolted slightly as Fae wielded the artificial being that pulled the cart to a halt. The two Asimi rankers drop off the vehicle.

They found a place to post. The place was as fine as an outdoor firing range. Bermuda grasses filled the wide surface of the ground. The moon illuminates the area with its chilling light.

Shira was standing at a far point in front of Dexor. She was lost in thought as she assessed the man in front of her. He was tall, with a clanky tower safeguard on his left. “What’s this person's soul ability? Rumor’s said that this person is impossible to break.” Shira looked at the man's left side, holding a wavy-bladed weapon.

Dexor breathed and spoke detachedly. He said, “Shira, there are other ways to deal with this back in the guild.”
Shira raised her head and glimpsed the moon. She then breathed and stared at Dexor and said, “I hate that place.

Let’s settle this as soon as possible here.” Shira’s thoughts started to race as she spoke to herself: “What the heck are you talking about? Why are you acting like a kid? Damn it, I don't know anymore!” She looked at the two fools, Rekko and Fae, staring at her. She asked herself, “What the hell? Why are you people worried as hell?”

Shira flattens her lips, her eyes full of resolve. Insulted, she ignited her fist, then cast her third soul ability, arctic-moon-wolf-coat. The evening dictates her full potential. Her aquamarine hair turned into light. Her upper face was blocked by a mask, leaving the eye visible. All of her limbs and extremities are surrounded by flaming light, shaping like fur. Her hands were formed with sharp claws. She was turned into a beast that lurks in the darkness.

The green Bermuda grass was frozen. The Philippines never experiences snow, yet the place is now white and cold.

A voice distracted Shira’s focus. It rang in her ear and made her stare in its direction. “Rekko, it is good to minimise your ability to produce the maximum result.” It was Dexor having a chit chat with Rekko, and he added, “Only focus on the approaching impact.”

Shira lost it. She was very mad that the veins on her forehead became visible. She started to run to approach Dexor. It was so sudden that her opponent couldn’t react to her speed. And before the opposing force could dance through combat experience, the person was crystalized, assuring Shira of her victorious outcome.
The impact broke the crickets evening. Echoing destruction of crystal shards. A mist of dust blocks everyone’s sight.

Abruptly, a shield was struck in Shira’s trunk. The force from it surpassed the strength she committed. Before she even noticed, she was thrown in mid-air and began to bounce on the ground. Her body kissed the chilling land.

Her thoughts go through different mazes. “What was that? ”She lifted her body with the help of her limbs, yet her balance was not there. It was at that moment that she realised that her right arm hand had been crushed from the impact. Her trunk ached, and blood poured down the floor. Her mouth was bubbling with crimson fluid.

Shira looked into her opponent’s dead fish's eyes. He walked enigmatically, predatorily, towards Shira. Shadows and lights overlap, succumbing the hues of the vicinity. Every step he took made her sweat. She tried to move her other arm for an escape. However, the man in front of her opened a bottle of liquid and poured it on her.

The liquid instantly healed Shira's arms and torso. Shira shamelessly seizes this as an opportunity to get her ground and assault. But it ended up in the same scenario, only this time her legs were cramped. The man, clad in white plate, started pouring the same toxic fluid on her.

Shira, consumed in fury, unleashed a brutal elbow strike on the man. But the assault recoiled and pushed her back. Her arm went numb. Gasping in pain, she spat out, “Why are you so hard!?”

Yet the man continued his torturous way of fighting. He broke Shira’s arm, ribs, and fingers, and then approached it with care with the potion. Scream of agony cleared the silent night.

This was the first time Shira was humiliated with pure strength alone. With each strike she delivers, it leads her only to immense torment—all physical attacks seem futile.

Shira raised her lips in one end, smirked, then said, “You, Dimwit, I have never thought to put such resolve.” The man halted his steps upon hearing the calm, proud voice. Shira cast the disgusting ability she has been avoiding. With a detached smirk on her face, she said, “Stalemate!”

[Styx Compact Vow]:

Two souls will be bound by the hand of the Death Reaper. Both the caster and target will be paralyzed until they consent to the pact.

[Ability Type]: Soul Attack

The emanating light Shira possessed was extracted by a force above. It formed a translucent ethereal being. Its dark hood blocks half of its menacing face. The huge skeleton hands that are enveloped by billowing dark fabric approached the two Asimi dwellers, yanked their souls, and knotted them together. Poor Death Reaper, summoned just to reconcile two arguing kids.

The phenomenon struck Shira to the ground along with Dexor. Both can’t flinch a single finger. The aquamarine-haired lady's lips raised in both ends, and she said, “Now it’s a battle of wills!”

The man, clad in white armour, muttered, “Battle of will, my ass. You made things worse for me.” He added, “I’m not supposed to marry like this.”

The end of the lore of Shira.
