Twisted and ticking, the doors hinged, creaked open and gave passage through a dark room. The metallic click of the key grew silent as it found itself hung to the side. Dim light began to illuminate the room. Cracks of bones echoed as Ken twisted his neck—it sounded like twigs that snapped in two.

He took a seat on the only visible chair in the room, his fingers, meanwhile, brushed for a lump in a flat panel. Ken leaned all his weight to the chair’s backrest, both hands hung fall, His eyes drifted to the wall where a framed jersey was mounted—it almost touched the room's ceiling.

Light flickered from beneath, it pulled his gaze to the panel. The view drowned him with old memories. It made him smile for a moment. It has been quite a while since he felt like that. _Since when was the last? After I got a job, maybe?_ he wonders.

Regaining his senses from marvel, he moved his right arm to reach for the clicker. Swoosh-stop-click, it was his hand gesture. A word on display inside a white rectangular shape drawn on the screen was very familiar—only this time it was for him to watch. Swoosh-stop-click Play.

Hours blurred and he found himself smiling at the end of the series. It may not be canon to the story he was accustomed to, yet it was, well, spectacular to watch. He scrolled down then threw a glance at the viewers' responses. Some praised it, some thought it was made in haste. Ken, however, seemed indifferent. He rolled his eyes back at the framed jersey once more. He knew there were lots of stories to be made. Both for the game he once played—World of Runeterra—and for him beyond it.

### Authors Note
