May I ask how I can help you?&amp;rdquo; she said, her voice hints at worry.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The man sighed, his eyes stared at her unwavering. He replied, ”You&amp;rsquo;ve had a golden journey, but remember&amp;hellip;” He paused, the words heavy, “All roads lead to me.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>
