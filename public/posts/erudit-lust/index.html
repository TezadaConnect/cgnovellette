      <p>The sky was covered by white pigeons, and the streets were throbbing with busy vehicles. Lorence was excited about his new technical job. With a bright smile, he approached his colleagues, trying to fit in.</p>
<p>However, the work was fascinating&mdash;advanced technologies were introduced like a whirlwind, and Lorence couldn’t help but feel overwhelmed.</p>
<p>Yet he approached the task with curiosity and energy. His colleagues were willing to guide him whenever he needed help. He dove into learning, bit by bit, until he mastered his tools.</p>
<p>Each day his growth’s monumental, leaving his peers behind. His questions reached beyond what they could answer.</p>
<p>Lorence was already ahead of the curve on a day when everyone else in the office was discussing something new they had learned. He discussed them more.</p>
<p>It seems that yesterday they taught him&mdash;today he seems arrogant. But all he had done was to learn.</p>
<h3 id="authors-note">Authors Note</h3>
<p>Was invited to a wedding party where I saw an old colleague. Back then, I remember he had little background in a particular technology I was enthusiastic about. I taught him the mindset needed to approach it, and now, I think his skill level is decent, as I’m very familiar with the tech. However, I realized that the office I left behind has a considerable skill gap compared to him now.</p>
<p>This short story I wrote was inspired by that encounter. It reminded me of myself when my peers had difficulty keeping up with me. Whenever they felt like I was being arrogant, I would tell them that I’m just very enthusiastic about the subject, and I’m sorry if it comes off that way.</p>
