      <p>The hiss of the grass had been going on for an hour now. Lilac was panting as she desperately clung to her prey for the day, moving with precise efficiency as she chased the wild, carnivorous buck. Not just any buck, but a huge gray one. Lilac was armed with a formidable arsenal of hunting weapons, yet they seemed ineffective against the wounded beast.</p>
<p>As the minutes passed, Lilac tripped and fell onto the grassy land of the Yagacan plains, a place where tall grass and scattered shrubs stood against the piercing sunlight. She felt a numbing frustration as she lay there, the weight of her repeated failure crushing her spirit.</p>
<p>Dragging herself to her feet, she saw a silhouette at the far edge of the plain. It was the carnivorous buck, wounded but taunting her from afar before it darted away once again.</p>
<p>Lilac arrived at the central tribe, her home, Gacania—a tribe that takes great pride in hunting. As usual, she brought nothing but herself, empty-handedly observing her peers who were successfully pursuing greatness by the tribe&rsquo;s standards.</p>
<p>She walked toward a large hut, entered, and was about to rest when a man appeared before her, his gaze filled with curiosity about her recent activities. Lilac sighed, signaling a consistent failure in her hunt. She shrugged in dismay and said, “Well, at least I can run for an hour now.”</p>
<p>The man, who happened to be the chieftain in charge of the tribe, responded, “Lady Lilac, it is a great feat! I’m honored to see you progressing despite the setbacks.” His voice always rang with respect for the daughter of the deceased chieftain. “In no time, you’ll claim this position of mine and lead the tribe!”</p>
<p>“Come on, old man! I know what you want. Sit down here, and I’ll relieve the eternal ache in your shoulder.” She rolled her eyes in irritation, yet she asked with killing seriousness in her thoughts, ‘I wonder, when will I become a chieftain like Father and the great hunter Sisera?’</p>
<p>After the healing session with Chieftain Sisera, she rested in her room for the whole afternoon. When the sun met the lines of the plain in the west, she fled from the tribe to a secluded spot. It was a place in the Yagacan plain where a single tree stood out from the endless grasses of the savannah—a place where she could reflect and train secretly by herself.</p>

<h3 id="authors-note">Authors Note</h3>
<p>While many Filipino books and reading materials often delve into themes of love, tragedy, revenge, and betrayal, my story aims to shine a light on different aspects of life. I want to explore the impact of tradition on individuals and communities, the struggles of self-doubt, and the spirit of bayanihan. These themes are deeply rooted in my experiences growing up in the Philippines and offer a fresh perspective on the complexities of Filipino life in a fantastical lens.</p>

          <p>I lead a life that defies convention. My mornings are spent tending the family farm, where the rhythms of nature provide a grounding touch. By day, I delve into the complexities of code as a software developer, unraveling the secrets of technology. When evening descends, I immerse myself in crafting a fantastical world, weaving epic tales and grand adventures. It&rsquo;s mesmerizing how these seemingly disparate roles—farming, coding, and storytelling—blend to create a life steeped in diversity and imagination.</p>
