      <description>&lt;p&gt;Twisted and ticking, the doors hinged, creaked open and gave passage through a dark room. The metallic click of the key grew silent as it found itself hung to the side. Dim light began to illuminate the room. Cracks of bones echoed as Ken twisted his neck—it sounded like twigs that snapped in two.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He took a seat on the only visible chair in the room, his fingers, meanwhile, brushed for a lump in a flat panel. Ken leaned all his weight to the chair’s backrest, both hands hung fall, His eyes drifted to the wall where a framed jersey was mounted—it almost touched the room&amp;rsquo;s ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
