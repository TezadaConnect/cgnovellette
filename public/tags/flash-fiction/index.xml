      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lab speaks in silence, after that, noises can be heard. White walls are stained by dried red under the lined lights. Cut here and there, it is just another day against the captive specimen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If duty calls, then I could engage in horror. I’ve done this. It was a great pursuit in biology. Well, It once was, before the day it striked.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Have nothing now but disgraced perhaps. Still, I’ll pluck one finger and another. One organ and another, and there will be far more worse.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Twisted and ticking, the doors hinged, creaked open and gave passage through a dark room. The metallic click of the key grew silent as it found itself hung to the side. Dim light began to illuminate the room. Cracks of bones echoed as Ken twisted his neck—it sounded like twigs that snapped in two.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He took a seat on the only visible chair in the room, his fingers, meanwhile, brushed for a lump in a flat panel. Ken leaned all his weight to the chair’s backrest, both hands hung fall, His eyes drifted to the wall where a framed jersey was mounted—it almost touched the room&amp;rsquo;s ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The sky was covered by white pigeons, and the streets were throbbing with busy vehicles. Lorence was excited about his new technical job. With a bright smile, he approached his colleagues, trying to fit in.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, the work was fascinating&amp;mdash;advanced technologies were introduced like a whirlwind, and Lorence couldn’t help but feel overwhelmed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yet he approached the task with curiosity and energy. His colleagues were willing to guide him whenever he needed help. He dove into learning, bit by bit, until he mastered his tools.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Clair&amp;rsquo;s tummy growled with hunger; she had no time to cook. The plans were ready, and the lessons were about to begin. Yet time ticked away as if it were about to leave her behind.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;She ran through the sidewalks and hailed a public vehicle. Once seated, she calmed herself, as if this brief moment was hers alone. The vehicle sped quickly, and soon it was time to get off and walk toward a towering building.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The road was inevitable as a bachelorette walked toward the building. Inside, a man in a dark suit waited for her, watching her through the glass walls. She passed through and greeted him with a smile honed by years of practice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Good day, sir. May I ask how I can help you?&amp;rdquo; she said, her voice hints at worry.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The man sighed, his eyes stared at her unwavering. He replied, ”You&amp;rsquo;ve had a golden journey, but remember&amp;hellip;” He paused, the words heavy, “All roads lead to me.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>
