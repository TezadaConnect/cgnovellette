      <description>&lt;p&gt;The road was inevitable as a bachelorette walked toward the building. Inside, a man in a dark suit waited for her, watching her through the glass walls. She passed through and greeted him with a smile honed by years of practice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Good day, sir. May I ask how I can help you?&amp;rdquo; she said, her voice hints at worry.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The man sighed, his eyes stared at her unwavering.
